{"Symbol": "CREE", "AssetType": "Common Stock", "Name": "Cree, Inc", "Description": "Cree, Inc. provides lighting-class light emitting diode (LED) and semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency (RF) applications in the United States, China, Europe, and internationally. It operates in two segments, Wolfspeed and LED Products. The Wolfspeed segment offers silicon carbide (SiC) materials for RF, power switching, gemstones, and other applications. It also provides SiC power device products, including SiC Schottky diodes, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), power modules, and gate driver boards for electric vehicles, including charging infrastructure, server power supplies, solar inverters, uninterruptible power supplies, industrial power supplies, and other applications. In addition, this segment offers gallium nitride (GaN) die, high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), and laterally diffused MOSFET (LDMOS) power transistors for telecommunications infrastructure, military, and other commercial applications; and custom die manufacturing services for GaN HEMTs and MMICs. The LED Products segment provides blue and green LED chip products for video screens, gaming displays, function indicator lights and automotive backlights, headlamps, and directional indicators. It also offers XLamp LED components and LED modules for lighting applications; and surface mount and through-hole packaged LED products for video, signage, general illumination, transportation, gaming, and specialty lighting applications. The company was founded in 1987 and is headquartered in Durham, North Carolina.", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "Currency": "USD", "Country": "USA", "Sector": "Technology", "Industry": "Semiconductors", "Address": "4600 Silicon Drive, Durham, NC, United States, 27703", "FullTimeEmployees": "5130", "FiscalYearEnd": "June", "LatestQuarter": "2020-06-30", "MarketCapitalization": "6991003136", "EBITDA": "9300000", "PERatio": "None", "PEGRatio": "7.32", "BookValue": "19.071", "DividendPerShare": "None", "DividendYield": "0", "EPS": "-3.622", "RevenuePerShareTTM": "8.374", "ProfitMargin": "-0.2121", "OperatingMarginTTM": "-0.1696", "ReturnOnAssetsTTM": "-0.0317", "ReturnOnEquityTTM": "-0.0923", "RevenueTTM": "903900032", "GrossProfitTTM": "256800000", "DilutedEPSTTM": "-1.78", "QuarterlyEarningsGrowthYOY": "0", "QuarterlyRevenueGrowthYOY": "-0.181", "AnalystTargetPrice": "65.92", "TrailingPE": "0", "ForwardPE": "232.5581", "PriceToSalesRatioTTM": "7.4393", "PriceToBookRatio": "3.2803", "EVToRevenue": "7.0585", "EVToEBITDA": "213.5658", "Beta": "1.1648", "52WeekHigh": "74.72", "52WeekLow": "27.77", "50DayMovingAverage": "67.4881", "200DayMovingAverage": "51.9202", "SharesOutstanding": "108160000", "SharesFloat": "109121126", "SharesShort": "12547054", "SharesShortPriorMonth": "12597671", "ShortRatio": "12.88", "ShortPercentOutstanding": "0.11", "ShortPercentFloat": "0.131", "PercentInsiders": "0.66", "PercentInstitutions": "97.906", "ForwardAnnualDividendRate": "0", "ForwardAnnualDividendYield": "0", "PayoutRatio": "0", "DividendDate": "None", "ExDividendDate": "None", "LastSplitFactor": "2:1", "LastSplitDate": "2000-12-11"}
