{"Symbol": "IXYS", "AssetType": "Common Stock", "Name": "IXYS Corp", "Description": "IXYS Corporation, an integrated semiconductor company, designs, develops, manufactures, and markets semiconductor products worldwide. It provides power semiconductors, such as power metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), thyristors, and rectifiers, including fast-recovery epitaxial diodes to control electricity in power conversion systems, motor drives, medical electronics, and renewable energy sources. The company also offers integrated circuits (ICs) comprising microcontrollers to control electronic devices, such as remote controllers, motors, and user interfaces on appliances; solid-state relays that isolate the low current communication signal from the higher power circuit; analog and mixed-signal application specific ICs; and power management and control ICs, such as current regulators, motion controllers, digital power modulators, and drivers for power MOSFETs and IGBTs. In addition, it provides radio frequency power semiconductors consisting of field-effect transistors, pseudomorphic-high-electron-mobility transistors, Gunn diodes, and monolithic microwave ICs that enable the amplification and reception of radio frequencies in telecommunication, industrial, defense, and space applications; and systems and other products that comprise laser diode drivers, high voltage pulse generators and modulators, and high power subsystems. The company markets and sells its products through direct sales personnel, independent representatives, and distributors. IXYS Corporation was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Milpitas, California.", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "Currency": "USD", "Country": "USA", "Sector": "Other", "Industry": "Other", "Address": "1590 Buckeye Drive\n95035,Milpitas,USA\n", "FullTimeEmployees": "1003", "FiscalYearEnd": "March", "LatestQuarter": "None", "MarketCapitalization": "759158656", "EBITDA": "44458000", "PERatio": "32.6487", "PEGRatio": "1.71", "BookValue": "9.899", "DividendPerShare": "0", "DividendYield": "0", "EPS": "0.74", "RevenuePerShareTTM": "0", "ProfitMargin": "0", "OperatingMarginTTM": "0", "ReturnOnAssetsTTM": "0", "ReturnOnEquityTTM": "0", "RevenueTTM": "0", "GrossProfitTTM": "0", "DilutedEPSTTM": "0", "QuarterlyEarningsGrowthYOY": "0", "QuarterlyRevenueGrowthYOY": "0", "AnalystTargetPrice": "23", "TrailingPE": "0", "ForwardPE": "0", "PriceToSalesRatioTTM": "0", "PriceToBookRatio": "0", "EVToRevenue": "0", "EVToEBITDA": "0", "Beta": "None", "52WeekHigh": "None", "52WeekLow": "None", "50DayMovingAverage": "0", "200DayMovingAverage": "0", "SharesOutstanding": "0", "SharesFloat": "0", "SharesShort": "0", "SharesShortPriorMonth": "0", "ShortRatio": "0", "ShortPercentOutstanding": "0", "ShortPercentFloat": "0", "PercentInsiders": "0", "PercentInstitutions": "0", "ForwardAnnualDividendRate": "0", "ForwardAnnualDividendYield": "0", "PayoutRatio": "0", "DividendDate": "None", "ExDividendDate": "None", "LastSplitFactor": "None", "LastSplitDate": "None"}
